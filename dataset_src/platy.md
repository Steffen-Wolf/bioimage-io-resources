#Platynereis EM Segmentation Training Data

Training data for segmentation of cellular membranes, nuclei, cuticle and cilia in Platynereis dumerilii.
The training data is extracted from a whole body EM volume of a Platynereis larva that was used
to train networks for segmentation in [Whole-body integration of gene expression and single-cell morphology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.07.017).
For each organelle several blocks of training data are available, extracted at dfferent resolutions:
20x20x25nm for cellular membranes, 80x80x100nm for nuclei, 40x40x50nm for cuticle and 10x10x25nm for cilia.
