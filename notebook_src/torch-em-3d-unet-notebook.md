# 3D UNet Training

Train a 3d UNet for a segmentation task with the [torch_em](https://github.com/constantinpape/torch-em) library.

`torch_em` is a thin wrapper around `pytorch` for training models for segmentation and other image analysis tasks in microscopy.
This notebooks implements training a 3d network with it on preconfigured datasets or on your own custom data.
It is also [available via google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/torch-em/blob/main/experiments/3D-UNet-Training.ipynb).
